# Coding Standards

## 🎯 Scope

This section covers comprehensive coding conventions, quality standards, and development practices:

#### In Scope:

- Code formatting and style conventions across multiple languages
- Comprehensive error handling patterns and strategies
- Versioning strategies and semantic versioning implementation
- Technical debt identification, measurement, and management
- Internationalization and localization frameworks
- Code quality metrics, enforcement, and automation

#### Out of Scope:

- Framework-specific patterns (covered in Code Design)
- Testing strategies (covered in Testing)
- Architecture patterns (covered in Architecture)

## 📋 Content Description
