# Git Workflow Standards

Comprehensive framework for Git version control and development process standards that optimize team collaboration, code quality, and project maintainability.

## Purpose

Establish enterprise-grade Git workflow standards that maximize development velocity while ensuring code quality, project stability, and effective team collaboration through systematic version control practices.

## Available Resources

### Standards and Guidelines

- **[Development Process](development-process.md)** - Development lifecycle, branching strategy, and collaboration workflow
- **[Version Control](version-control.md)** - Git practices, commit standards, and repository management
- **[Quality Assurance](quality-assurance.md)** - Code review process, testing gates, and quality controls

### Key Focus Areas

#### Version Control Excellence

- Strategic branching and merging strategies
- Commit message standards and conventions
- Repository organization and management
- Git best practices and automation

#### Development Process Optimization

- Feature development lifecycle
- Code review and approval workflows
- Integration and deployment processes
- Collaboration and communication patterns

#### Quality Assurance Integration

## Git Workflow Maturity Model

### Level 1: Basic Version Control

- Linear development with simple branching
- Manual integration and conflict resolution
- Basic branch protection rules

### Level 2: Structured Branching

- Standardized branch naming and lifecycle
- Mandatory pull request review process
- CI/CD integration with quality gates

### Level 3: Strategic Git Operations

- Release automation and management

### Level 4: Git-Native Development

- Semantic versioning and automated changelog
- AI-powered code analysis and review
- Full deployment automation with monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Principles

- All changes via pull requests (no direct commits)
- Mandatory code review for quality assurance
- Automated testing on every change
- Clear commit messages and branch naming

### Workflow Standards

- Strategic branching strategy selection
- Quality-first integration processes
- Semantic development practices
- Comprehensive documentation

### Team Collaboration

- Clear review and approval processes
- Effective communication patterns
- Knowledge sharing and mentoring
- Continuous process improvement

- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message format
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automated version management
- **Clear History**: Readable and navigable Git history

## Branching Strategy Framework

### GitHub Flow (Recommended for Most Projects)

#### **Branch Structure**

```text
main (production)
├── feature/user-authentication
├── feature/dashboard-ui
├── hotfix/security-patch-v1.2.1
└── release/v2.0.0
```

#### **Workflow Process**

1. **Create Feature Branch**: `feature/description-of-change`
2. **Develop & Commit**: Follow conventional commit standards
3. **Push & Create PR**: Automated testing and review
4. **Review & Merge**: Squash merge to maintain clean history
5. **Deploy**: Automated deployment from main branch

### GitFlow (For Complex Release Cycles)

#### **Branch Structure**

```text
main (production releases)
develop (integration branch)
├── feature/new-feature
├── release/v2.0.0
└── hotfix/critical-bug-fix
```

#### **When to Use GitFlow**

- Complex release schedules
- Multiple simultaneous releases
- Large teams with parallel development
- Enterprise environments with staged deployments

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Standard Branch Types

#### **Feature Branches**

```text
feature/user-authentication
feature/dashboard-redesign
feature/api-v2-integration
```

#### **Bug Fix Branches**

```text
bugfix/login-validation-error
bugfix/dashboard-loading-issue
bugfix/api-timeout-handling
```

#### **Hotfix Branches**

```text
hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
hotfix/critical-performance-issue
hotfix/production-data-corruption
```

#### **Release Branches**

```text
release/v2.0.0
release/v1.5.3
release/quarterly-update-q1
```

### Branch Naming Decision Matrix

| Type    | Pattern               | Merges To      | Lifecycle   |
| ------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Feature | `feature/description` | develop/main   | Short-term  |
| Bugfix  | `bugfix/description`  | develop/main   | Short-term  |
| Hotfix  | `hotfix/description`  | main + develop | Immediate   |
| Release | `release/version`     | main + develop | Medium-term |

## Commit Message Standards

### Conventional Commits Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

#### **Primary Types**

- **feat**: New feature implementation
- **fix**: Bug fix or issue resolution
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no logic changes)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature changes
- **test**: Test additions or modifications
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks and tooling updates

#### **Examples**

```bash
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 integration with Google
fix(api): resolve timeout issues in user authentication
docs(readme): update installation instructions for new dependencies
refactor(utils): simplify date formatting functions
test(auth): add comprehensive tests for login flow
chore(deps): update React to v18.2.0
```

### Breaking Changes

```text
feat(api)!: redesign user authentication endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication API has been redesigned to use JWT tokens instead of session cookies. Existing clients will need to update their authentication flow.
```

## Pull Request Standards
