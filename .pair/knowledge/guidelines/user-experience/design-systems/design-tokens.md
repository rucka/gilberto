## Design Token Strategy

### Token Taxonomy and Hierarchy

**Foundational tokens (Global level)**:

- **Typography scale**: Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights forming typographic hierarchy
- **Spacing system**: Consistent spacing scale for layout rhythm and component spacing
- **Border and shadow values**: Consistent visual depth and separation through standardized border and shadow tokens

**Semantic tokens (Alias level)**:

- **Functional color tokens**: Button colors, text colors, background colors mapped to specific UI functions
- **Component-specific tokens**: Button padding, card spacing, form field dimensions for consistent component design
- **State-based tokens**: Hover, active, disabled, error states with consistent visual feedback across components
- **Responsive tokens**: Breakpoint-aware values for consistent responsive behavior and layout adaptation

**Component tokens (Component level)**:

- **Component variant tokens**: Primary button, secondary button, danger button with specific styling variations
- **Component state tokens**: Component-specific hover, focus, active states with appropriate visual feedback
- **Component size tokens**: Small, medium, large component variations with proportional scaling
- **Component theme tokens**: Light mode, dark mode, high contrast variations for accessibility and user preference

### Token Value Management

**Systematic value definition**:

- Mathematical relationships between token values ensuring harmonious visual rhythm and proportional scaling
