# Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) Methodology

## Overview

Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) is a framework for scaling agile development that applies Scrum principles, practices, and rules to large product development efforts involving multiple teams. LeSS provides organizational design principles and practices that enable teams to scale Scrum while maintaining the simplicity and empiricism of Scrum.

## Core Principles

### LeSS Principles

**More with LeSS** - LeSS is about scaling up Scrum by doing less, not more

- Avoiding organizational complexity and overhead
- Focusing on essential elements that create value
- Eliminating waste in coordination and communication
- Maintaining team autonomy and self-organization

**Whole Product Focus** - All teams work on one product with one Product Owner

- Unified product vision and backlog
- Shared understanding of customer value
- Coordinated delivery of integrated increments
- Elimination of component team silos

**Customer-Centric** - Direct customer interaction and learning

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Regular customer feedback and validation
- Adaptive planning based on customer needs
- Value delivery optimization over feature completion

**Continuous Improvement Towards Perfection** - Kaizen mindset

- Regular retrospectives at all levels
- Systematic removal of impediments
- Learning and adaptation culture
- Pursuit of technical and organizational excellence

**Lean Thinking** - Eliminate waste and optimize flow

- Value stream optimization
- Just-in-time decision making
- Respect for people and teams
- Systems thinking approach

**Systems Thinking** - Understanding interconnections and dependencies

- Optimizing the whole system, not individual parts
- Addressing root causes, not symptoms
- Long-term perspective over short-term gains
- Continuous learning and adaptation

**Empirical Process Control** - Inspection, adaptation, and transparency

- Regular inspect-and-adapt cycles
- Data-driven decision making
- Transparent communication and feedback
- Experimental approach to improvement

**Queuing Theory** - Understanding and managing flow

- Work-in-progress limits
- Batch size optimization
- Cycle time reduction
- Flow efficiency improvement

## Framework Structure

## Implementation Guide

### Organizational Design

#### Feature Teams Over Component Teams

```text
Traditional Component Organization:

├── Business Logic Team (4 developers)
├── Database Team (2 developers)
└── Integration Team (3 developers)

LeSS Feature Team Organization:
├── Feature Team A (6 developers - full-stack)
├── Feature Team B (6 developers - full-stack)
└── Feature Team C (6 developers - full-stack)
```

#### Team Formation Principles:

- **Cross-functional** - All skills needed to deliver features
- **Co-located** - Preferably in same physical space
- **Stable** - Long-term team membership for learning
- **Self-organizing** - Teams decide how to work
- **Customer-focused** - Direct customer interaction

#### Organizational Structure:
