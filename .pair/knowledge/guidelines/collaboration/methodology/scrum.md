# Scrum Methodology

## Overview

Sprint-based iterative development framework that provides structure for complex product development while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing requirements through regular inspection and adaptation cycles.

## Core Framework

### Scrum Theory

#### Empirical Process Control

- **Transparency**: All aspects of process visible to those responsible for outcome
- **Inspection**: Regular examination of artifacts and progress toward goals
- **Adaptation**: Adjustment based on inspection results to minimize deviation

#### Scrum Values

- **Commitment**: Dedication to achieving team goals and deliverables
- **Courage**: Willingness to tackle difficult problems and speak up
- **Focus**: Concentration on sprint work and team objectives
- **Openness**: Transparent communication about work and challenges
- **Respect**: Mutual respect for team members' capabilities and perspectives

### Scrum Roles

#### Product Owner

- Maximizes value of product and work of Development Team
- Manages Product Backlog including content, availability, and ordering
- Ensures Development Team understands items to appropriate level
- Single person, not committee (may represent stakeholder desires)

#### Scrum Master

- Facilitates Scrum process and removes impediments
- Coaches team on Scrum practices and continuous improvement
- Protects team from external disruptions during sprints
- Facilitates Scrum events and ensures they are productive

#### Development Team

- Cross-functional professionals who deliver product increment
- Self-organizing team that determines how to accomplish work
- Collectively responsible for all development activities
- Optimal size: 3-9 members (excluding Product Owner and Scrum Master)

### Scrum Events

#### Sprint

```text
Duration: 1-4 weeks (2 weeks recommended)
Purpose: Time-boxed period to create usable, potentially shippable product increment
Characteristics:
- Fixed duration throughout project
- No changes that endanger Sprint Goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated with Product Owner
```

#### Sprint Planning

```text
Duration: Maximum 8 hours for 4-week sprint (proportionally less for shorter sprints)
Participants: Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)
Purpose: Plan work to be performed during Sprint

Agenda:
1. What can be delivered in upcoming Sprint? (Sprint Goal)
2. How will chosen work get done? (Sprint Backlog)

Outputs:
- Sprint Goal (objective that provides guidance to Development Team)
- Sprint Backlog (Product Backlog items + plan for delivering them)
```

#### Daily Scrum

```text
Duration: 15 minutes maximum
Participants: Development Team (others may attend but only observe)
Purpose: Synchronize activities and create plan for next 24 hours

Format (each team member addresses):
1. What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet Sprint Goal?
2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet Sprint Goal?
3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or Development Team from meeting Sprint Goal?

Guidelines:
- Same time and place every day
- Development Team members only speak
- Detailed discussions happen after Daily Scrum
```

#### Sprint Review

```text
Duration: Maximum 4 hours for 4-week sprint
Participants: Scrum Team + key stakeholders
Purpose: Inspect Increment and adapt Product Backlog if needed

Agenda:
1. Product Owner explains what was and wasn't done
2. Development Team demonstrates work done and answers questions
3. Product Owner discusses Product Backlog as it stands
4. Entire group collaborates on what to do next
5. Review of timeline, budget, potential capabilities for next release

Output: Revised Product Backlog defining probable items for next Sprint
```

#### Sprint Retrospective

```text
Duration: Maximum 3 hours for 4-week sprint
Participants: Scrum Team only
Purpose: Inspect how last Sprint went and create plan for improvements

Format:
1. What went well during Sprint?
2. What could be improved?
3. What will we commit to improve in next Sprint?

Guidelines:
- Occurs after Sprint Review and before next Sprint Planning
- Focus on people, relationships, process, and tools
- Create actionable improvement items
- Most important Scrum event for continuous improvement
```

### Scrum Artifacts

#### Product Backlog

```text
Definition: Ordered list of everything known to be needed in product
Characteristics:
- Single source of requirements for any changes to be made
- Product Owner responsible for content, availability, and ordering
- Never complete - evolves as product and environment evolve
- Dynamic - constantly changes to identify what product needs

Item Qualities:
- Description (user story format recommended)
- Order/Priority
- Estimate (relative sizing preferred)
- Value (business value to stakeholders)
- Test criteria (acceptance criteria)
```

#### Sprint Backlog

```text
Definition: Product Backlog items selected for Sprint + plan for delivering them
Characteristics:
- Forecast by Development Team about functionality for next Increment
- Plan for delivering Product Backlog items and realizing Sprint Goal
- Only Development Team can change Sprint Backlog during Sprint
- Visible, real-time picture of work Development Team plans to accomplish

Components:
- Selected Product Backlog items
- Tasks to complete selected items
- Sprint Goal
- Progress tracking (burndown charts, task boards)
```

#### Increment

```text
Definition: Sum of all Product Backlog items completed during Sprint + value of Increments of all previous Sprints
Characteristics:
- Must be in useable condition regardless of whether Product Owner decides to release it
- Must meet Definition of Done
- Must be potentially shippable
- Inspected at Sprint Review

Quality Standards:
- Meets all acceptance criteria
- Passes all tests (unit, integration, acceptance)
- Documented appropriately
- Deployed to staging/demo environment
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started with Scrum

#### Team Formation

```text
Week 1-2: Team Setup
