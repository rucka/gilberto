## Code Review & PR Management

### PR Review States

GitHub supports three review actions. The `/pair-process-review` skill uses these through a tool-agnostic interface — this section documents the GitHub-specific implementation.

#### Review Actions

| Action             | GitHub API Value    | When to Use                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approve            | `APPROVE`           | All review checks pass, no blocking issues                 |
| Request Changes    | `REQUEST_CHANGES`   | Blocking issues found that must be fixed before merge      |
| Comment            | `COMMENT`           | Non-blocking feedback, questions, or suggestions           |

#### MCP-First Approach

```text
# Submit a review (preferred — uses MCP GitHub server)
mcp__github__pull_request_review_write:
  method: create
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  pullNumber: [N]
  event: APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | COMMENT
  body: "Review summary"
```

#### CLI Fallback

```bash
# When MCP is unavailable
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --approve --body "Review summary"
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --request-changes --body "Changes needed: ..."
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --comment --body "Feedback: ..."
```

#### Pending Review Workflow (Multi-Comment Reviews)

For reviews with line-specific comments, use the pending review pattern:

```text
# Step 1: Create pending review (no event = pending)
mcp__github__pull_request_review_write:
  method: create
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  pullNumber: [N]

# Step 2: Add line comments to pending review
mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review:
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  pullNumber: [N]
  path: "src/file.ts"
  line: 42
  body: "Comment on this line"
  subjectType: LINE
  side: RIGHT

# Step 3: Submit the pending review
mcp__github__pull_request_review_write:
  method: submit_pending
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  pullNumber: [N]
  event: REQUEST_CHANGES
  body: "Overall review summary"
```

### Merge Strategy

GitHub supports three merge methods. The adopted strategy is configured in [way-of-working.md](../../../../adoption/tech/way-of-working.md) under the Merge Strategy section.

#### Merge Methods

| Method | GitHub API Value | Commit History                        | Best For                          |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Squash | `squash`         | Single commit on target branch        | Feature branches, clean history   |
| Merge  | `merge`          | Merge commit preserving all commits   | Long-lived branches, audit trail  |
| Rebase | `rebase`         | Linear history, no merge commit       | Small PRs, linear history fans    |

#### MCP-First Approach

```text
# Merge a PR (preferred)
mcp__github__merge_pull_request:
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  pullNumber: [N]
  merge_method: squash | merge | rebase
  commit_title: "[#story-id] feat: description"
  commit_message: "Detailed commit message"
```

#### CLI Fallback

```bash
# When MCP is unavailable
gh pr merge [PR_NUMBER] --squash --subject "[#ID] feat: description" --body "Details"
gh pr merge [PR_NUMBER] --merge
gh pr merge [PR_NUMBER] --rebase
```

### Hierarchy Queries

GitHub Projects supports hierarchical work items (Initiative → Epic → Story). Use these patterns to query parent-child relationships.

#### Check Sub-Issues of a Parent

```text
# Get sub-issues of an epic or initiative (MCP)
mcp__github__issue_read:
  method: get_sub_issues
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  issue_number: [parent_issue_number]
```

#### CLI Fallback for Hierarchy

```bash
# List sub-issues of a parent issue
gh api repos/[org]/[repo]/issues/[number]/sub_issues

# Check if all children of an epic are done
# Parse the response and check state of each sub-issue
```

#### Recursive Parent Cascade Logic

When closing a story after merge, evaluate the parent hierarchy:

1. **Get parent epic** — read the story's parent issue reference
2. **Get all siblings** — query all sub-issues of the parent epic
3. **Check completion** — if ALL sibling stories have `state: closed`, close the parent epic
4. **Recurse** — repeat for the epic's parent (initiative)

```text
# Step 1: Get epic's sub-issues
mcp__github__issue_read:
  method: get_sub_issues
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  issue_number: [epic_number]

# Step 2: Check if all sub-issues are closed
# If all closed → close the epic
mcp__github__issue_write:
  method: update
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  issue_number: [epic_number]
  state: closed
  state_reason: completed

# Step 3: Repeat for initiative (epic's parent)
```

### Project Board Status Transitions

Update the project board status field for intermediate transitions (Todo → Refined, Refined → In Progress) and final transitions (→ Done).

**Important**: The project board status field is separate from the issue state (open/closed). Updating the issue body text `**Status**: Refined` is **not** the same as updating the board field. Always update the board field via GraphQL mutation.

#### Step 1: Discover Project and Field IDs

```bash
# Find project ID, status field ID, and option IDs
gh api graphql -f query='{
  organization(login: "[ORG]") {
    projectV2(number: [PROJECT_NUMBER]) {
      id
      fields(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
            id name
            options { id name }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

#### Step 2: Find the Item ID for the Issue

```bash
# Paginate project items to find the issue
gh api graphql -f query='{
  organization(login: "[ORG]") {
    projectV2(number: [PROJECT_NUMBER]) {
      items(first: 50) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          content { ... on Issue { number } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
# Use pageInfo.endCursor for pagination if needed
```

#### Step 3: Update the Status Field

```bash
# Transition to any status (e.g., Refined, In Progress, Done)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation {
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
    projectId: "[PROJECT_ID]"
    itemId: "[ITEM_ID]"
    fieldId: "[STATUS_FIELD_ID]"
    value: { singleSelectOptionId: "[TARGET_STATUS_OPTION_ID]" }
  }) { projectV2Item { id } }
}'
```

#### Common Transitions

| Transition | When | Triggered by |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Todo → Refined | Story refinement complete | `/pair-process-refine-story` via `/pair-capability-write-issue $status: Refined` |
| Refined → In Progress | Implementation starts | `/pair-process-implement` via `/pair-capability-write-issue $status: In Progress` |
| In Progress → Done | PR merged + issue closed | `/pair-process-review` merge step |

### Issue Close (Post-Merge)

Close the issue after merge. The board status transition to Done should happen via the mutation above; closing the issue updates only the issue state.

#### MCP-First Approach

```text
# Close the story issue
mcp__github__issue_write:
  method: update
  owner: [org]
  repo: [repo]
  issue_number: [story_number]
  state: closed
  state_reason: completed
```

#### CLI Fallback

```bash
# Close issue
gh issue close [NUMBER] --reason completed
```
