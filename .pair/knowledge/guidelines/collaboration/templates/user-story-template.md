- [Requirements to be clarified]

## Definition of Done Expectations

**Standard DoD Requirements** (to be detailed during refinement):

- [ ] Functionality implemented and working
- [ ] **UI demonstrates the user value** (screen, interaction, feedback, data display)
- [ ] Automated tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] **Demo-ready for sprint review** (clear user story value visible in UI)

## Dependencies

**Story Dependencies**: [Other user stories this likely depends on]
**Epic Dependencies**: [Epic-level dependencies affecting this story]

## Notes

[Brief additional context, assumptions, or planning considerations - uncertainty is expected and normal]
