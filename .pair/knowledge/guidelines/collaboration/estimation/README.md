### Estimation Method Decision Tree

```text
Start: What type of project are you estimating?

├── New product/feature with little historical data?
│   ├── Team inexperienced with estimation?
│   │   └── → Use AI-Assisted Estimation
│   └── Team experienced?
│       └── → Use Complexity-Based Estimation
│
├── Enhancement to existing system?

│   └── Different type of work?
│       └── → Use Complexity-Based Estimation
│
├── Fixed deadline/budget project?
│   └── → Use Time-Based Estimation (primary) + Forecast-Based (validation)
│
└── Large complex project spanning multiple teams?
    └── → Use Hybrid Estimation approach
