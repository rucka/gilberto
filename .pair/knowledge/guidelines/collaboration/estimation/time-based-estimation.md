# Time-Based Estimation

## Overview

Traditional time-focused estimation using hours, days, and calendar-based planning that provides direct alignment with schedules, budgets, and resource allocation for projects with fixed deadlines and contract requirements.

## Core Principles

### Direct Time Mapping

#### Calendar Integration

- Direct correlation between estimates and project timelines
- Integration with scheduling tools and resource management
- Clear alignment with business deadlines and commitments
- Straightforward budget calculation and resource allocation

#### Granular Planning

- Hour-level precision for detailed task planning
- Day-level estimation for user story and feature work
- Week-level planning for epic and initiative scheduling
- Multiple granularity levels for different planning horizons

#### Resource Allocation

- Direct mapping of estimated time to team capacity
- Individual developer assignment and workload management
- Skill-based allocation and specialized expertise planning
- Clear identification of resource constraints and bottlenecks

## Estimation Techniques

### Three-Point Estimation (PERT)

#### PERT Formula

```text
Optimistic (O): Best-case scenario, everything goes perfectly
Most Likely (M): Realistic scenario based on normal conditions
Pessimistic (P): Worst-case scenario with significant challenges

Expected Time (E) = (O + 4M + P) / 6
Standard Deviation (σ) = (P - O) / 6
```

#### Example Application

```text
Task: Implement user authentication system
Optimistic: 3 days (everything works perfectly)
Most Likely: 6 days (normal development with typical issues)
Pessimistic: 12 days (complex integration problems)

Expected Time = (3 + 4×6 + 12) / 6 = 39/6 = 6.5 days
Standard Deviation = (12 - 3) / 6 = 1.5 days
```

#### Confidence Intervals

```text
68% confidence: E ± σ = 6.5 ± 1.5 = 5 to 8 days
95% confidence: E ± 2σ = 6.5 ± 3 = 3.5 to 9.5 days
99% confidence: E ± 3σ = 6.5 ± 4.5 = 2 to 11 days
```

### Bottom-Up Estimation

#### Task Decomposition Process

1. **Break Down Work**: Decompose user stories into specific tasks
2. **Estimate Tasks**: Provide time estimates for each individual task
3. **Sum Estimates**: Aggregate task estimates for story total
4. **Add Buffers**: Include integration, testing, and coordination time
5. **Validate Total**: Check story estimate against experience and complexity

#### Task-Level Guidelines

```text
Development Tasks:
- Coding: 2-8 hours per task
- Unit Testing: 20-30% of coding time
- Code Review: 10-20% of coding time
- Integration: 1-4 hours per integration point

Quality Tasks:
- Manual Testing: 50-100% of development time
- Bug Fixing: 20-40% of development time
- Documentation: 10-20% of development time
- Deployment: 1-4 hours per environment
```

### Top-Down Estimation

#### Analogical Estimation

1. **Identify Similar Work**: Find previously completed similar features
2. **Analyze Differences**: Identify factors that make new work different
3. **Apply Adjustments**: Adjust historical time based on differences
4. **Validate Estimate**: Compare with bottom-up estimates if available

#### Parametric Estimation

```text
Function Point Analysis:
- Count functional elements (inputs, outputs, files, interfaces)
- Apply complexity weights (simple, average, complex)
- Calculate total function points
- Apply productivity rates (hours per function point)

Example:
Total Function Points: 150
Team Productivity: 8 hours per function point
Estimated Effort: 150 × 8 = 1,200 hours = 6 person-months
```

## Buffer Management and Risk Adjustment

### Buffer Types

#### Task-Level Buffers

- Technical uncertainty: 20-50% for unknown technologies
- Integration complexity: 10-30% for cross-system integration
- Quality requirements: 20-40% for high-quality/critical systems
- Learning curve: 30-100% for new team members or technologies

#### Story-Level Buffers

- Coordination overhead: 10-20% for cross-team dependencies
- Requirements clarification: 10-30% for unclear or evolving requirements
- Testing and validation: 20-50% depending on quality requirements
- Deployment and rollout: 5-15% for production deployment activities

#### Epic-Level Buffers

- Project management overhead: 10-20% for coordination and communication
- Risk contingency: 20-40% for high-risk or innovative projects
- Scope creep: 10-30% for projects with evolving requirements
- Integration testing: 15-25% for complex multi-component systems

### Risk-Adjusted Estimation

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

```text
Risk Level | Probability | Impact | Time Multiplier
Low        | <20%       | Minor  | 1.1x
Medium     | 20-50%     | Moderate| 1.3x
High       | 50-80%     | Major  | 1.6x
Critical   | >80%       | Severe | 2.0x+
```

#### Risk Categories

- **Technical Risks**: New technologies, complex algorithms, performance requirements
- **Integration Risks**: Third-party systems, legacy integration, data migration
- **Team Risks**: New team members, skill gaps, availability constraints
- **External Risks**: Vendor dependencies, regulatory changes, market pressures

## Implementation Framework

### Estimation Process

#### Preparation Phase

1. **Gather Requirements**: Ensure clear and complete user story definition
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map out technical and business dependencies
3. **Assess Team Capacity**: Consider individual skills and availability
4. **Review Historical Data**: Analyze similar work and team performance

#### Estimation Phase

1. **Individual Estimates**: Team members provide independent estimates
2. **Discussion and Alignment**: Discuss differences and assumptions
3. **Consensus Building**: Reach agreement on final estimates
4. **Documentation**: Record estimates, assumptions, and rationale

#### Validation Phase

1. **Sanity Checks**: Compare with similar historical work
2. **Capacity Validation**: Ensure estimates fit within sprint capacity
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Get approval for significant estimates
4. **Adjustment**: Refine estimates based on feedback and new information

### Tracking and Calibration

#### Actual vs. Estimated Tracking

```markdown

```

### Advanced Estimation Techniques

#### Monte Carlo Simulation

```python
import random
import numpy as np

def monte_carlo_time_estimation(optimistic, most_likely, pessimistic, iterations=1000):
    estimates = []

    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Beta PERT distribution simulation
        estimate = random.betavariate(
            alpha=(optimistic + 4*most_likely + pessimistic) / 6,
            beta=(pessimistic - optimistic) / 6
        )
        estimates.append(estimate)

    return {
        'mean': np.mean(estimates),
        'std': np.std(estimates),
        '50th_percentile': np.percentile(estimates, 50),
        '80th_percentile': np.percentile(estimates, 80),
        '95th_percentile': np.percentile(estimates, 95)
    }
```

#### Earned Value Management (EVM)

```text
Planned Value (PV): Budgeted cost of scheduled work
Earned Value (EV): Budgeted cost of completed work
Actual Cost (AC): Actual cost of completed work

Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV
Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC
Estimate at Completion (EAC) = Budget at Completion / CPI
```

## Best Practices

### Estimation Guidelines

#### Estimation Granularity

- Tasks: 2-16 hours (half-day to 2-day maximum)
- User Stories: 1-5 days (avoid stories larger than 1 sprint)
- Epics: 1-4 sprints (break down if larger)
- Initiatives: 1-6 months (high-level planning only)

#### Quality Assurance

- Multiple estimators for critical or large items
- Regular calibration sessions with historical data
- Documentation of assumptions and dependencies
- Review and approval process for significant estimates

#### Communication and Transparency

- Clear communication of estimate uncertainty and confidence levels
- Regular updates on actual vs. estimated progress
- Transparent discussion of estimation challenges and lessons learned
- Stakeholder education on estimation limitations and variability

Time-based estimation provides direct alignment with business timelines and resource planning while requiring careful attention to accuracy, buffer management, and continuous calibration for reliable project planning.
