## Decision Framework

### Workspace Architecture Patterns

| Pattern        | Use Cases                                                            | Benefits                                                         | Considerations                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monorepo**   | Multiple related projects, shared dependencies, coordinated releases | Code sharing, atomic changes, unified tooling                    | Complex build systems, large repository size       |
| **Multi-repo** | Independent projects, different technologies, separate teams         | Clear boundaries, independent deployment, technology flexibility | Dependency management complexity, code duplication |
| **Hybrid**     | Mixed project types, gradual migration, organizational constraints   | Flexibility, gradual adoption, legacy integration                | Increased complexity, tooling challenges           |

### Selection Criteria

#### Project Characteristics

- **Project Relationships**: Tightly coupled vs. independent projects
- **Technology Stack**: Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous technologies
- **Development Velocity**: Release frequency and coordination needs
- **Team Structure**: Shared teams vs. independent teams

#### Organizational Factors

- **Team Size**: Small teams vs. large organizations
- **Collaboration Patterns**: High collaboration vs. autonomous teams
- **Governance Requirements**: Compliance, security, and audit needs
- **Infrastructure Maturity**: CI/CD capabilities and tooling sophistication

## Implementation Patterns

### Monorepo Organization

#### Hierarchical Structure

```

#### Domain-Based Organization

```text
workspace/
├── domains/
│   ├── user-management/    # User-related functionality
│   │   ├── api/           # User management API
│   │   ├── ui/            # User interface components
│   │   └── shared/        # Domain-specific shared code
│   ├── payment-processing/ # Payment-related functionality
│   ├── inventory-management/
│   └── reporting/
├── shared/                 # Cross-domain shared resources
│   ├── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure components
│   ├── design-system/      # UI design system
│   └── utilities/          # Common utilities
└── platform/              # Platform and tooling
    ├── build-tools/
    ├── deployment/
    └── monitoring/
```

### Multi-repo Organization

#### Repository Structure

```text
Organization Repositories:
├── frontend-app/           # Frontend application repository
├── backend-api/           # Backend API repository
├── mobile-app/            # Mobile application repository
├── shared-components/     # Shared UI components library
├── common-utilities/      # Shared utility functions
├── infrastructure/        # Infrastructure as code
├── deployment-scripts/    # Deployment automation
└── documentation/         # Project documentation
```

#### Dependency Management

- Use package managers for shared dependencies
- Implement semantic versioning for shared packages
- Plan for dependency update coordination
- Monitor and manage version compatibility

### Hybrid Organization

#### Mixed Structure

```text
Organization:
├── core-platform/         # Monorepo for core platform
│   ├── apps/
│   ├── packages/
│   └── tools/
├── feature-services/      # Individual service repositories
│   ├── notification-service/
│   ├── analytics-service/

## Best Practices

### Structure and Organization

#### Clear Boundaries

- Define clear separation between applications, libraries, and tools
- Use consistent naming conventions across the workspace
- Implement proper dependency direction and avoid circular dependencies
- Document architectural decisions and constraints

#### Scalability Planning

- Design for growth in projects, teams, and complexity
- Plan for efficient build and test execution
- Implement proper caching and optimization strategies
- Consider workspace partitioning and modularization

### Development Workflow

#### Build and Test Optimization

- Implement incremental builds and affected project detection
- Use parallel execution for builds and tests
- Plan for efficient CI/CD pipeline execution
- Monitor and optimize build performance

#### Code Sharing and Reuse

- Create shared libraries for common functionality
- Implement consistent coding standards and patterns
- Plan for versioning and compatibility management
- Document shared resources and usage patterns

### Tooling and Automation

#### Workspace Management

- Use workspace management tools (Nx, Lerna, Rush, etc.)
- Implement consistent tooling across projects
- Plan for tool configuration sharing and management
- Automate routine workspace maintenance tasks

#### Development Environment

- Provide consistent development environment setup
- Use containerization for environment consistency
- Plan for efficient development workflow integration
- Document setup and onboarding procedures

### Collaboration and Governance

#### Team Coordination

- Establish clear ownership and responsibility models
- Implement code review and approval processes
- Plan for cross-team collaboration and communication
- Use appropriate branching and merging strategies

#### Quality and Standards

- Implement consistent quality gates and standards
- Use automated testing and validation
- Plan for compliance and security requirements
- Monitor and enforce architectural constraints

## Advanced Patterns

### Federated Architecture

- Implement micro-frontend or microservice patterns
- Use module federation for runtime code sharing
- Plan for independent deployment and scaling
- Coordinate shared dependencies and interfaces

### Polyglot Workspaces

- Support multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Implement language-specific tooling and workflows
- Plan for cross-language integration and communication
- Manage heterogeneous dependency and build systems

### Legacy Integration

- Plan for gradual migration from legacy systems
- Implement integration patterns for legacy components
- Use strangler fig pattern for gradual replacement
- Maintain compatibility during transition periods

## Migration Strategies

### Monorepo Migration

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current repository structure and dependencies
2. **Planning**: Design target monorepo structure and migration plan
3. **Incremental Migration**: Gradually move projects into monorepo
4. **Tooling Setup**: Implement monorepo management tools and workflows
5. **Optimization**: Optimize build and development workflows

### Multi-repo Migration

1. **Decomposition**: Identify independent components and services
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Map dependencies and shared code
3. **Repository Creation**: Create separate repositories with proper structure
4. **Package Publication**: Set up shared package publishing and distribution
5. **Workflow Coordination**: Implement cross-repository coordination workflows

This workspace organization guidance enables teams to choose and implement workspace structures that support their specific needs while maintaining productivity and code quality.
