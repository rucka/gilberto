# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation Guide

Comprehensive guide for implementing Domain-Driven Design principles in system architecture.

## Purpose

Provide practical implementation guidance for Domain-Driven Design patterns, bounded context mapping, and domain modeling techniques.

## DDD Core Concepts

### Strategic Design

- **Subdomains**: Business capability areas classified as core, supporting, or generic
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between domain models
- **Context Mapping**: Relationships and integration patterns between contexts
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between domain experts and developers

### Tactical Design

- **Entities**: Objects with identity and lifecycle
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries and transaction boundaries
- **Domain Services**: Domain logic that doesn't belong to entities
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction for aggregates

## Implementation Patterns

### Bounded Context Implementation

```typescript
// Bounded Context Structure
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── value-objects/
│   ├── aggregates/
│   ├── services/
│   └── repositories/
├── application/
│   ├── use-cases/
│   ├── command-handlers/
│   └── query-handlers/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── services/
│   └── adapters/
└── presentation/
    ├── controllers/
    ├── dto/
    └── mappers/
```

### Context Integration Patterns

- **Shared Kernel**: Shared domain model between contexts
- **Customer/Supplier**: Upstream/downstream relationship
- **Conformist**: Downstream adapts to upstream model
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Translation layer between contexts
