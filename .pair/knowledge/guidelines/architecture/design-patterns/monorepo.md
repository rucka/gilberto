# Monorepo Architecture

Strategic framework for implementing monorepo architectures that enable efficient code sharing, coordinated development, and scalable project management.

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive guidance for designing and implementing monorepo structures that support multiple projects while maintaining development velocity and code quality.

## Decision Framework

### Monorepo Benefits and Trade-offs

| Aspect                    | Benefits                                                  | Trade-offs                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Code Sharing**          | Easy sharing of utilities, components, and configurations | Increased coupling between projects       |
| **Dependency Management** | Unified dependency versions, atomic updates               | Complex dependency resolution             |
| **Development Workflow**  | Consistent tooling, unified CI/CD                         | Longer build times, complex branching     |
| **Team Collaboration**    | Enhanced visibility, easier refactoring                   | Potential for conflicts, merge complexity |

### Suitability Assessment

#### Ideal for Monorepo

- Multiple related projects with shared dependencies
- Teams that collaborate frequently on shared components
- Organizations requiring consistent tooling and standards
- Projects with coordinated release cycles

#### Consider Alternatives

- Completely independent projects with different lifecycles
- Teams with very different technology stacks
- Organizations with strict security or compliance boundaries
- Large codebases with performance constraints

## Implementation Patterns

### Structure Patterns

#### Application-Centric Structure

```

### Dependency Management

#### Package.json Organization

```json
// Root package.json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*", "tools/*"],
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nx/workspace": "latest",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "nx run-many --target=build",
    "test": "nx run-many --target=test",
    "lint": "nx run-many --target=lint"
  }
}
```

#### Version Management Strategy

- **Unified Versions**: Single version for all shared dependencies
- **Lock File Management**: Use single lock file for consistency
- **Dependency Hoisting**: Leverage workspace hoisting for efficiency
- **Version Pinning**: Pin critical dependencies for stability

### Build and Test Optimization

#### Incremental Builds

```yaml
# Nx configuration example
{
  'version': 2,
  'projects':
    {
      'web-app':
        {
          'root': 'apps/web-app',
          'sourceRoot': 'apps/web-app/src',
          'targets':
            {
              'build':
                {
                  'executor': '@nx/next:build',
                  'dependsOn': ['^build'],
                  'inputs': ['default', '^default', '{workspaceRoot}/next.config.js'],
                },
            },
          'implicitDependencies': ['ui-components', 'business-logic'],
        },
    },
}
```

#### Affected Project Detection

- Use dependency graphs to identify affected projects
- Implement intelligent test execution based on changes
- Optimize CI/CD pipelines with affected project builds
- Monitor and cache build artifacts for efficiency

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

#### Clear Boundaries

- Define clear interfaces between packages and applications
- Avoid circular dependencies between packages
- Use consistent naming conventions across the monorepo
- Implement proper dependency direction (apps depend on packages)

#### Shared Resource Management

- Create reusable packages for common functionality
- Implement versioning strategy for internal packages
- Use TypeScript for better development experience
- Document package APIs and usage patterns

### Development Workflow

#### Branching Strategy

```text
Monorepo Branching:
├── main                   # Production-ready code
├── develop               # Integration branch
├── feature/user-auth     # Feature development
├── feature/payment-flow  # Parallel feature development
└── hotfix/security-fix   # Critical fixes
```

#### Code Review Process

- Implement affected file analysis for targeted reviews
- Use CODEOWNERS for package-specific review requirements
- Plan for cross-team collaboration on shared packages
- Establish guidelines for breaking changes

### Tooling and Automation

#### Monorepo Management Tools

#### Nx (Recommended for TypeScript/JavaScript)

```bash
# Installation and setup
npx create-nx-workspace@latest myworkspace --preset=ts

# Common commands
nx build myapp                    # Build specific app
nx test myapp                     # Test specific app
nx run-many --target=build        # Build all projects
nx affected --target=test         # Test affected projects
```

#### Lerna (Package Publishing Focus)

```bash
# Installation and setup
npm install -g lerna
lerna init

# Common commands
lerna bootstrap                   # Install dependencies
lerna run test                    # Run tests across packages
lerna publish                     # Publish changed packages
```

#### Rush (Enterprise Scale)

```bash
# Installation and setup
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
rush init

# Common commands
rush install                      # Install dependencies
rush build                        # Build all projects
rush test                         # Run tests
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Build Performance

- Implement distributed builds and caching
- Use incremental compilation and builds
- Optimize dependency resolution and hoisting
- Monitor and profile build performance

#### Development Experience

- Use watch mode for development builds
- Implement hot module replacement for fast feedback
- Optimize IDE integration and IntelliSense
- Minimize development server startup time

### CI/CD Integration

#### Pipeline Optimization

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Required for Nx affected commands

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build affected projects
        run: npx nx affected --target=build --parallel=3

      - name: Test affected projects
        run: npx nx affected --target=test --parallel=3

      - name: Lint affected projects
        run: npx nx affected --target=lint --parallel=3
```

#### Deployment Strategy

- Implement independent deployment for applications
- Use affected project detection for deployment optimization
- Plan for coordinated releases when necessary
- Monitor deployment success and rollback procedures

## Advanced Patterns

### Micro-frontend Integration

- Use module federation for runtime code sharing
- Implement independent deployment with shared dependencies
- Plan for version compatibility and API contracts
- Use shell applications for micro-frontend orchestration

### Code Generation and Automation

- Implement code generators for consistent project structure
- Use schematics for automated code scaffolding
- Plan for configuration and boilerplate automation
- Maintain code generation templates and patterns

### Cross-Project Refactoring

- Use AST-based refactoring tools for large-scale changes
- Implement automated migration scripts for breaking changes
- Plan for coordinated updates across projects
- Use type safety for refactoring confidence

## Migration and Adoption

### Migration to Monorepo

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate existing repositories and dependencies
2. **Structure Design**: Plan target monorepo structure
3. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate monorepo management tools
4. **Incremental Migration**: Gradually move projects into monorepo
5. **Workflow Optimization**: Optimize build and development workflows

### Team Onboarding

- Provide comprehensive documentation and guides
- Implement training programs for monorepo workflows
- Use mentoring and pair programming for knowledge transfer
- Establish best practices and coding standards

This monorepo architecture guidance enables organizations to successfully implement and scale monorepo solutions while maintaining development productivity and code quality.
