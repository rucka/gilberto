# System Design

## Overview

System design focuses on the high-level architecture and scalability considerations for software systems. This document provides frameworks for designing systems that can handle growth in users, data, and complexity.

## Core Principles

### 1. Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to handle increased load
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading hardware resources on existing servers
- **Database Scaling**: Sharding, read replicas, and partitioning strategies

### 2. Reliability

- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating despite component failures
- **Redundancy**: Backup systems and failover mechanisms
- **Circuit Breakers**: Preventing cascade failures

### 3. Performance

- **Latency Optimization**: Reducing response times
- **Throughput Maximization**: Handling more requests per second
- **Caching Strategies**: Multiple levels of caching

## System Design Process

### 1. Requirements Gathering

```text
Functional Requirements:
- What the system should do
- Core features and user interactions
- Data processing needs

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance expectations (latency, throughput)
- Scalability targets (users, data volume)
- Availability requirements (uptime expectations)
- Security and compliance needs
```

### 2. Capacity Estimation

```text
User Estimation:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Peak concurrent users
- Growth projections

Data Estimation:
- Data storage requirements
- Read/write ratios
- Data retention policies

Traffic Estimation:
- Requests per second
- Peak load multipliers
- Seasonal variations
```

### 3. High-Level Design

```text
System Components:
- Client applications (web, mobile)
- Load balancers
- Application servers
- Databases
- Caching layers
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

Data Flow:
- Request/response patterns
- Data processing pipelines
- Integration points
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Microservices Architecture

```text
Benefits:
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Team autonomy
- Fault isolation

Challenges:
- Distributed complexity
- Network latency
- Data consistency
- Service discovery
```

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

```text
Components:
- Event producers
- Event brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Event consumers
- Event stores

Benefits:
- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Real-time processing
- Audit trails
```

### 3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

```text
Separation:
- Command models (writes)
- Query models (reads)
- Different optimization strategies

Use Cases:
- Complex business logic
- Different read/write patterns
- Performance optimization
- Audit requirements
```

## Technology Selection

### Database Choices

```text
Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL):
- ACID compliance
- Complex queries
- Strong consistency

NoSQL Databases:
- Document stores (MongoDB)
- Key-value stores (Redis)
- Column-family (Cassandra)
- Graph databases (Neo4j)
```

### Caching Strategies

```text
Browser Caching:
- Static assets
- API responses with cache headers

CDN Caching:
- Global content distribution
- Static and dynamic content

Application Caching:
- In-memory caches (Redis, Memcached)
- Database query caching
- Computed results caching
```

### Message Queues

```text
Use Cases:
- Asynchronous processing
- Decoupling services
- Load leveling
- Reliability

Technologies:
- Apache Kafka (high throughput)
- RabbitMQ (reliable messaging)
- AWS SQS (managed queuing)
- Redis Pub/Sub (simple messaging)
```

## Scalability Patterns

### 1. Load Balancing

```text
Types:
- Round Robin
- Least Connections
- Weighted Round Robin
- Geographic

Implementation:
- Hardware load balancers
- Software load balancers (Nginx, HAProxy)
- Cloud load balancers (AWS ALB, Google LB)
```

### 2. Database Scaling

```text
Read Replicas:
- Distribute read traffic
- Async replication
- Eventually consistent

Sharding:
- Horizontal partitioning
- Shard key selection
- Cross-shard queries

Federation:
- Split databases by function
- Reduces read/write traffic
- More complex joins
```

### 3. Caching Layers

```text
Multi-Level Caching:
- Browser cache
- CDN cache
- Reverse proxy cache
- Application cache
- Database cache

Cache Patterns:
- Cache-aside
- Write-through
- Write-behind
- Refresh-ahead
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics

```text
Performance Metrics:
- Response time (latency)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

Business Metrics:
- User engagement
- Conversion rates
- Feature usage
- Revenue impact
```

### Monitoring Stack

```text
Components:
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Log aggregation (ELK Stack)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Alerting (AlertManager)
- Dashboards (Grafana)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Design for Failure

- Assume components will fail
- Implement graceful degradation
- Use circuit breakers
- Plan for disaster recovery

### 2. Keep It Simple

- Start with simple solutions
- Add complexity only when needed
- Prefer proven technologies
- Document architectural decisions

### 3. Measure Everything

- Monitor system health
- Track user behavior
- Measure business impact
- Use data for decisions

### 4. Security by Design

- Implement defense in depth
- Use encryption in transit and at rest
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Premature Optimization

- Don't optimize before measuring
- Focus on bottlenecks
- Consider cost vs. benefit
- Monitor after optimization

### 2. Over-Engineering

- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Build for current needs with room to grow
- Consider maintenance overhead
- Keep team capabilities in mind

### 3. Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance planning from the start
- Security considerations early
- Scalability architecture decisions
- Operational requirements
