# Deployment Architecture Patterns

Strategic guidance for selecting and implementing deployment architecture patterns based on team size, technical requirements, and business constraints.

## Purpose

Provide decision frameworks and implementation guidance for different deployment architecture patterns, helping teams choose the most appropriate approach for their specific context and requirements.

## Available Architecture Patterns

- **[Desktop Self-Hosted](desktop-self-hosted.md)** - Self-contained desktop deployment patterns
- **[Structured Monolith](structured-monolith.md)** - Organized monolithic architecture with clear boundaries
- **[Modular Monolith](modular-monolith.md)** - Loosely coupled modules within single deployment
- **[Microservices](microservices.md)** - Distributed service-oriented architecture
- **[Serverless](serverless.md)** - Function-based, event-driven deployment
- **[Hybrid Architecture](hybrid.md)** - Combined patterns for complex requirements

## Architecture Selection Framework

### Decision Criteria Matrix

#### Team and Organizational Factors

- Team size and experience level
- Development velocity and coordination needs
- Operational expertise and infrastructure capabilities
- Budget and resource constraints

#### Technical Requirements

- Scalability and performance requirements
- Integration and dependency complexity
- Data consistency and transaction requirements
- Security and compliance needs

#### Business Context

- Time to market pressures
- Risk tolerance and reliability requirements
- Future growth and evolution plans
- Maintenance and operational considerations

### Pattern Characteristics Comparison

| Pattern                 | Deployment Complexity | Development Speed | Operational Overhead | Scalability | Data Consistency      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| **Structured Monolith** | Low                   | High              | Low                  | Vertical    | Strong                |
| **Modular Monolith**    | Low-Medium            | High              | Low-Medium           | Vertical    | Strong                |
| **Microservices**       | High                  | Medium            | High                 | Horizontal  | Eventually Consistent |
| **Serverless**          | Medium                | Medium            | Low                  | Auto        | Eventually Consistent |
| **Hybrid**              | High                  | Variable          | Medium-High          | Mixed       | Mixed                 |

## Strategic Guidance

### When to Choose Each Pattern

#### Structured Monolith

- Small teams (1-5 developers)
- Simple to moderate business logic
- Strong consistency requirements
- Limited operational expertise
- Fast development and deployment needs

#### Modular Monolith

- Medium teams (3-10 developers)
- Complex business logic with clear domain boundaries
- Need for internal modularity without distribution overhead
- Transition path toward microservices
- Balance between simplicity and organization

#### Microservices

- Large teams (8+ developers) with service ownership model
- Complex, diverse business requirements
- Independent scaling and deployment needs
- Strong DevOps and operational capabilities
- Tolerance for eventual consistency

#### Serverless

- Event-driven or batch processing workloads
- Variable or unpredictable traffic patterns
- Cost optimization for intermittent usage
- Minimal operational overhead requirements
- Cloud-native development approach

#### Hybrid Architecture

- Mixed requirements across different system components
- Legacy system integration needs
- Gradual migration scenarios
- Different scalability patterns for different services
- Complex business and technical constraints

### Migration and Evolution Paths

#### Common Evolution Patterns

1. **Structured → Modular Monolith**: Add internal boundaries and modularity
2. **Modular Monolith → Microservices**: Extract modules to separate services
3. **Monolith → Hybrid**: Selective service extraction for specific needs
4. **Traditional → Serverless**: Function extraction for event-driven components

#### Migration Strategies

- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace monolith functionality
- **Database-per-Service**: Separate data concerns during service extraction
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Unified interface during transition
- **Event-Driven Decoupling**: Use events to reduce direct dependencies

## Implementation Considerations

### Development and Operations

**Team Structure Alignment**

- Conway's Law: Architecture reflects communication structure
- Service ownership and responsibility models
- Cross-functional team capabilities
- Knowledge sharing and collaboration patterns

#### Infrastructure and Tooling

- Container orchestration and deployment platforms
- Monitoring and observability requirements
- CI/CD pipeline complexity and coordination
- Infrastructure as code and automation needs

### Quality and Risk Management

**Testing Strategies**

- Unit testing complexity and coverage
- Integration testing across service boundaries
- End-to-end testing coordination
- Performance and load testing approaches

#### Risk Assessment

- Single points of failure and blast radius
- Data consistency and transaction management
- Service dependency and coupling risks
- Operational complexity and expertise requirements

## Decision Process

### Assessment Phase

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Constraint Identification**: Technical, organizational, and business constraints
3. **Current State Assessment**: Existing systems and technical debt
4. **Future State Vision**: Growth and evolution expectations

### Selection Phase

1. **Pattern Evaluation**: Compare patterns against criteria
2. **Prototype and Validation**: Proof of concept implementation
3. **Risk Analysis**: Technical and operational risk assessment
4. **Decision Documentation**: Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Implementation Phase

1. **Migration Planning**: Phased implementation approach
2. **Quality Gates**: Testing and validation criteria
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Observability and alerting implementation
4. **Team Training**: Skill development and knowledge transfer

This framework provides strategic guidance for architecture selection while recognizing that the best choice depends on specific context, constraints, and requirements rather than universal best practices.
