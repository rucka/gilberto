# Decision Frameworks

## 🎯 Scope

This section covers systematic approaches to architectural decision-making:

#### In Scope:

- Architecture Decision Record (ADR) processes and templates
- Decision tracking methodologies and tools
- Technology selection frameworks and criteria
- Evolution strategy planning and implementation
- Decision governance and review processes

#### Out of Scope:

- Implementation details of specific technologies
- Project management decision processes (covered in Collaboration)
- Business decision frameworks (covered in Product docs)

## 📋 Content Description

This folder provides structured frameworks for making and documenting architectural decisions. Each framework includes decision criteria, evaluation methods, and documentation templates to ensure consistent and traceable decision-making processes.

### Available Frameworks:

1. **ADR Process** (`adr-process.md`)

   - Architecture Decision Record templates
   - Decision documentation standards
   - Review and approval workflows

2. **Decision Tracking** (`decision-tracking.md`)

   - Decision lifecycle management
   - Impact assessment methods
   - Change request processes

3. **Technology Selection** (`technology-selection.md`)

   - Evaluation criteria frameworks
   - Proof of concept methodologies
   - Risk assessment templates

4. **Evolution Strategy** (`evolution-strategy.md`)
   - Architecture migration planning
   - Legacy system transition approaches
   - Continuous architecture improvement

### Selection Criteria Framework

#### For Technology Decisions:

- **Technical Fit**: Alignment with requirements and constraints
- **Team Capability**: Learning curve and existing expertise
- **Ecosystem**: Community support, libraries, documentation
- **Longevity**: Vendor stability, roadmap, migration path
- **Cost**: Licensing, maintenance, operational overhead

#### For Architecture Decisions:

- **Business Alignment**: Support for business goals and constraints
- **Technical Quality**: Performance, scalability, maintainability
- **Risk Assessment**: Implementation risk, operational risk
- **Resource Impact**: Development effort, operational cost
- **Strategic Fit**: Long-term technology direction
