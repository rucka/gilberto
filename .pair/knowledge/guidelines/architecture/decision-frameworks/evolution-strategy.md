- Requires extensive planning and testing
- Suitable for end-of-life systems

#### Parallel Run:

- Run old and new systems simultaneously
- Compare outputs and performance
- Gradual traffic migration
- Lower risk but higher cost

#### Branch by Abstraction:

- Create abstraction layer
- Gradually replace implementation
- Maintain single codebase
- Enable feature flagging

## Evolution Planning

### Phase-Based Approach

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

- Establish evolution governance
- Create architectural vision and roadmap
- Build team capabilities and skills
- Implement basic monitoring and metrics
- Start small, low-risk improvements

#### Phase 2: Momentum (Months 7-18)

- Execute major modernization initiatives
- Implement new architectural patterns
- Migrate critical components
- Establish new development practices
- Scale team and processes

#### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 19-36)

- Fine-tune performance and efficiency
- Complete remaining migrations
- Establish continuous improvement
- Share learnings and best practices
- Plan next evolution cycle

### Risk Management

#### Technical Risks:

- System instability during transition
- Data loss or corruption
- Performance degradation
- Integration failures
- Security vulnerabilities

#### Organizational Risks:

- Skill gaps and learning curves
- Team resistance to change
- Resource constraints and competing priorities
- Timeline delays and cost overruns
- Business disruption

#### Mitigation Strategies:

- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Gradual rollout and rollback plans
- Training and knowledge transfer
- Clear communication and change management
- Regular checkpoints and course correction

## Decision Framework

### Evolution Decision Tree

```text
Evolution Opportunity Identified
├── Is current system meeting business needs?
│   ├── YES → Consider incremental improvements
│   └── NO → Assess evolution necessity
├── What is the cost of not evolving?
│   ├── LOW → Defer evolution
│   └── HIGH → Plan evolution initiative
├── Do we have resources for evolution?
│   ├── NO → Secure resources or reduce scope
│   └── YES → Continue planning
├── What is the optimal evolution approach?
│   ├── Strangler Fig → Gradual replacement
│   ├── Big Bang → Complete replacement
│   ├── Parallel Run → Risk mitigation
│   └── Branch by Abstraction → Incremental change
└── Execute evolution with monitoring and adjustment
```
