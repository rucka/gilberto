# Structured Logging Guidelines

## Purpose

Define structured logging standards, formats, and best practices that enable efficient log analysis, debugging, and compliance while maintaining system performance.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Structured logging formats and standards
- Log level definitions and usage
- Contextual information strategies
- Sensitive data protection
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance optimization

#### Out of Scope:

- Log storage infrastructure
- Specific logging tool configurations
- Log visualization details
- Compliance audit procedures

## Introduction

Structured logging transforms traditional text-based logs into machine-readable, searchable, and analyzable data. This approach enables efficient debugging, monitoring, and analysis while supporting compliance and security requirements.

## Directory Contents

### Files

- `contextual-information.md` - Context enrichment and correlation strategies
- `json-logging.md` - JSON format standards and implementation
- `log-levels.md` - Log level definitions and usage guidelines
- `logging-standards.md` - Comprehensive logging standards and conventions
- `sensitive-data-protection.md` - Data privacy and security in logging

## Structured Logging Principles

### Machine Readability

- Consistent format structure
- Parseable data fields
- Standardized field names
- Type-safe data values

### Human Readability

- Clear message content
- Logical field organization
- Readable timestamp formats
- Contextual information

### Searchability

- Indexed field structure
- Query-optimized formats
- Consistent naming conventions
- Filterable data organization

## Implementation Strategy

### Format Selection

- JSON for structured data
- Key-value pairs for simple logs
- Standardized timestamp formats
- Consistent field hierarchies

### Context Enrichment

- Request correlation IDs
- User and session information
- Service and environment data
- Business context integration

### Performance Optimization

- Asynchronous logging patterns
- Efficient serialization
- Log level optimization
- Resource usage monitoring

## Log Format Comparison

| Format     | Readability | Parseability | Performance | Storage  | Best For            |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| JSON       | Medium      | High         | Medium      | Medium   | Structured analysis |
| Key-Value  | High        | High         | High        | Low      | Simple parsing      |
| Plain Text | High        | Low          | High        | Low      | Human debugging     |
| Binary     | Low         | High         | Very High   | Very Low | High volume systems |

## Decision Tree for Log Formats

```text
Start: What's your primary use case?

├── Human Debugging Primary
│   ├── Simple systems? → Key-Value format
│   └── Complex systems? → JSON with readable fields
│
├── Machine Analysis Primary
│   ├── High volume? → Binary format
│   ├── Complex queries? → JSON format
│   └── Simple parsing? → Key-Value format
│
└── Compliance Requirements
    ├── Audit trails? → JSON with full context
    └── Data protection? → Structured with PII handling
```

## Best Practices

### Logging Strategy

- Log meaningful events
- Include sufficient context
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Optimize for analysis needs

### Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous logging implementation
- Log level runtime configuration
- Buffer and batch optimization
- Resource impact monitoring

### Security and Privacy

- PII data exclusion
- Secure log transmission
- Access control implementation
- Data retention policies
