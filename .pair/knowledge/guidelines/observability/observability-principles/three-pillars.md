# Three Pillars of Observability

## Purpose

Define the foundational three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, traces) and their role in creating comprehensive system visibility.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Metrics, logs, and traces definitions and use cases
- Pillar integration and correlation strategies
- Data collection and analysis approaches
- Implementation best practices
- Tool selection considerations

#### Out of Scope:

- Specific tool configurations
- Vendor-specific implementations
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Cost optimization details

## The Three Pillars

### Metrics

**Definition:** Numerical measurements that represent system state and behavior over time.

#### Characteristics:

- Time-series data structure
- Aggregatable and comparable
- Efficient storage and querying
- Real-time alerting capability

#### Use Cases:

- Performance monitoring
- Capacity planning
- SLO/SLA tracking
- Business KPI measurement

### Logs

**Definition:** Timestamped records of discrete events that occurred within systems.

#### Characteristics:

- Rich contextual information
- Event-driven data generation
- Text-based or structured format
- Historical investigation capability

#### Use Cases:

- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Audit trails and compliance
- Error analysis and investigation
- Business event tracking

### Traces

**Definition:** Records of request flows through distributed systems showing service interactions.

#### Characteristics:

- Request correlation across services
- Timing and dependency information
- Service interaction mapping
- Performance bottleneck identification

#### Use Cases:

- Distributed system debugging
- Performance optimization
- Service dependency analysis
- Request flow understanding

## Pillar Integration

### Correlation Strategies

- Trace ID correlation across all pillars
- Timestamp synchronization
- Service identification consistency
- Context propagation standards

### Unified Analysis

- Cross-pillar investigation workflows
- Automated correlation detection
- Contextual data enrichment
- Holistic system understanding

## Implementation Guidance

### Data Collection

- Standardized instrumentation approaches
- Consistent data formats
- Efficient collection mechanisms
- Scalable storage solutions

### Analysis Workflows

- Pillar-specific analysis techniques
- Cross-pillar correlation methods
- Investigation best practices
- Problem resolution patterns
