# Metrics Guidelines

## Purpose

Define comprehensive metrics collection, analysis, and visualization strategies that provide actionable insights into system performance, user experience, and business outcomes.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Application and system metrics collection
- Business metrics and KPI tracking
- User experience metrics monitoring
- Performance metrics analysis
- Custom metrics design and implementation
- Metrics aggregation and visualization strategies

#### Out of Scope:

- Infrastructure hardware metrics (see Infrastructure Guidelines)
- Business intelligence and analytics (refer to dedicated BI documentation)
- Financial reporting metrics
- Marketing analytics metrics

## Introduction

Metrics provide quantitative insights into system behavior, performance, and business outcomes. This section establishes guidelines for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing metrics that enable data-driven decision making and proactive system management.

Effective metrics strategies focus on actionable insights rather than vanity metrics, ensuring that collected data directly supports operational and business objectives.

## Metrics Categories

### Application Metrics

#### Performance Metrics:

- Response time and latency
- Throughput and requests per second
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization

#### Reliability Metrics:

- Service availability and uptime
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Error budget consumption

#### Scalability Metrics:

- Concurrent user capacity
- Resource scaling effectiveness
- Load distribution metrics
- Auto-scaling performance

### Business Metrics

#### Revenue Metrics:

- Transaction volume and value
- Conversion rates
- Customer lifetime value
- Revenue per user

#### User Engagement:

- Active user counts
- Session duration
- Feature utilization rates
- User retention metrics

#### Operational Efficiency:

- Development velocity
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Cost per transaction

### User Experience Metrics

#### Frontend Performance:

- Page load times
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- First contentful paint (FCP)

#### User Journey Metrics:

- Funnel conversion rates
- Drop-off points
- User flow completion
- Error encounter rates

## Metrics Collection Strategy

### Collection Approaches

#### Push-Based Collection:

- Application pushes metrics to collectors
- Real-time metric delivery
- Higher network overhead
- Good for event-driven metrics

#### Pull-Based Collection:

- Collectors scrape metrics from applications
- Standardized collection intervals
- Lower application overhead
- Better for gauge metrics

#### Hybrid Collection:

- Combination of push and pull approaches
- Optimized for different metric types
- Balanced performance and flexibility
- Scalable collection architecture

### Instrumentation Strategies

#### Automatic Instrumentation:

- Framework-level metric collection
- Library-provided metrics
- Standard performance metrics
- Minimal code changes required

#### Manual Instrumentation:

- Business-specific metrics
- Custom performance indicators
- Domain-relevant measurements
- Higher implementation effort
