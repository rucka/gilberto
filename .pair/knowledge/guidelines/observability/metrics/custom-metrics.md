# Custom Metrics

## Purpose

Define guidelines for creating domain-specific and business-logic metrics that provide unique insights into application behavior and business performance.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Custom metric design principles
- Domain-specific measurement strategies
- Business logic performance tracking
- Implementation patterns and best practices
- Naming conventions and standards
- Performance impact considerations

#### Out of Scope:

- Standard infrastructure metrics
- Generic application metrics
- Third-party service metrics
- System-level measurements

## Design Principles

### Metric Design

- Clear purpose and actionability
- Consistent naming conventions
- Appropriate granularity level
- Business value alignment

### Implementation Considerations

- Minimal performance impact
- Efficient data structures
- Proper error handling
- Scalable collection patterns

## Custom Metric Categories

### Business Logic Metrics

- Domain-specific operations
- Workflow completion rates
- Business rule violations
- Process efficiency measures

### Feature Performance

- Feature-specific response times
- Usage pattern tracking
- Performance optimization metrics
- A/B testing measurements

### Quality Metrics

- Code quality indicators
- Test coverage metrics
- Technical debt measurements
- Deployment quality tracking

## Implementation Patterns

### Collection Strategies

- Event-driven metric generation
- Sampling and aggregation techniques
- Batch vs. real-time collection
- Performance optimization approaches

### Storage and Analysis

- Time series data modeling
- Aggregation level selection
- Retention policy design
- Query optimization strategies
