# Application Monitoring Metrics

## Purpose

Define application-specific metrics collection strategies that provide visibility into application performance, reliability, and user experience.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Application performance metrics
- Service reliability indicators
- User experience measurements
- Resource utilization tracking
- Error and exception monitoring
- Business logic performance

#### Out of Scope:

- Infrastructure hardware metrics
- Network-level monitoring
- Security event monitoring
- Database administration metrics

## Core Application Metrics

### Performance Metrics

#### Response Time Metrics:

- Average response time
- Percentile distributions (P50, P95, P99)
- Endpoint-specific latency
- Database query times

#### Throughput Metrics:

- Requests per second (RPS)
- Transactions per minute (TPM)
- Concurrent user capacity
- Processing rate metrics

### Reliability Metrics

#### Error Tracking:

- Error rate percentages
- Exception counts by type
- Failed request tracking
- Service degradation indicators

#### Availability Metrics:

- Service uptime percentage
- Health check success rates
- Dependency availability
- Circuit breaker status

### Resource Utilization

#### Application Resources:

- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization
- Thread pool utilization
- Connection pool metrics

#### External Dependencies:

- API response times
- Database connection health
- Message queue metrics
- Cache hit/miss ratios

## Implementation Guidelines

### Metric Collection

#### Instrumentation Approaches:

- Automatic framework instrumentation
- Custom business metric collection
- Library-provided metrics
- Manual instrumentation points

#### Collection Best Practices:

- Minimal performance impact
- Consistent naming conventions
- Appropriate sampling rates
- Efficient data structures

### Analysis and Alerting

#### Alert Configuration:

- SLO-based alerting
- Trend-based alerts
- Threshold optimization
- Multi-metric correlation

#### Performance Analysis:

- Bottleneck identification
- Trend analysis
- Capacity planning
- Optimization opportunities
