## Channel Selection Strategy

### Severity-Based Routing

#### Critical Alerts:

- Immediate: Push notification + SMS
- Follow-up: Voice call if unacknowledged
- Broadcast: Team channels for awareness
- Escalation: Manager notification

#### Warning Alerts:

- Primary: Slack/Teams notification
- Secondary: Email for documentation
- Escalation: SMS after threshold time
- Context: Dashboard visual indicators

#### Informational Alerts:

- Primary: Email notification
- Secondary: Dashboard updates
- Optional: Team channel posting
- Archive: Log aggregation systems

### Audience-Based Routing

#### On-Call Engineers:

- Immediate mobile notifications
- Multi-channel redundancy
- Escalation workflows
- Context-rich information

#### Development Teams:

- Team channel notifications
- Email summaries
- Dashboard integration
- Non-intrusive delivery

#### Management:

- High-level summary notifications
- Business impact information
- Escalation notifications only
- Weekly/monthly summaries

#### Customers/Stakeholders:

- Status page updates
- Proactive communication
- Impact-based notifications
- Resolution updates

## Message Design

### Content Structure

#### Alert Header:

- Clear severity indication
- Service/system identification
- Timestamp and duration
- Unique alert identifier

#### Problem Description:

- Concise problem statement
- Impact assessment
- Affected components
- Current status

#### Context Information:

- Recent changes or deployments
- Related incidents or alerts
- Performance trends
- Environmental information

#### Action Items:

- Immediate response steps
- Investigation starting points
- Escalation contacts
- Relevant documentation links

### Mobile Optimization

#### Character Limits:

- SMS: 160 characters maximum
- Push notifications: ~40 characters title, ~80 body
- Concise but complete information
- Abbreviation standards

#### Actionable Content:

- Clear next steps
- Direct links to investigation tools
- One-tap acknowledgment
- Quick response options

## Escalation Procedures

### Time-Based Escalation

#### Escalation Timing:

- Critical: 5 minutes unacknowledged
- Warning: 15 minutes unacknowledged
- Informational: No automatic escalation
- Custom timing based on service criticality

#### Escalation Paths:

- Primary on-call → Secondary on-call
- Engineering team → Team lead
- Team lead → Service owner
- Service owner → Management

### Condition-Based Escalation

#### Automatic Escalation Triggers:

- Multiple related alerts
- Severity increase
- Impact threshold exceeded
- External dependency failures

#### Manual Escalation:

- Responder requests assistance
- Complexity exceeds capability
- Cross-team coordination needed
- Executive visibility required

## Intelligent Routing

### Alert Correlation

#### Related Alert Grouping:

- Service dependency mapping
- Timeline-based correlation
- Impact cascade identification
- Root cause grouping

#### Noise Reduction:

- Duplicate alert suppression
- Flapping alert detection
- Maintenance window awareness
- Known issue correlation

### Context Enrichment

#### Automatic Context Addition:

- Recent deployment information
- Service health history
- Related metric trends
- Relevant documentation links

#### Dynamic Content:

- Real-time metric values
- Current system status
- Impact assessment
- Suggested actions

## Notification Timing

### Delivery Optimization

#### Time Zone Considerations:

- Follow-the-sun support models
- Regional on-call schedules
- Business hours awareness
- Global team coordination

#### Frequency Management:

- Burst protection mechanisms
- Rate limiting for repeated alerts
- Digest mode for low-priority alerts
- Quiet hours configuration

### Business Context

#### Business Hours Adaptation:

- Escalation speed adjustment
- Channel preference changes
- Stakeholder availability
- Impact assessment modification

#### Holiday and Weekend Handling:

- Reduced escalation paths
- Extended response times
- Emergency contact protocols
- Automated response enhancement

## Response Integration
