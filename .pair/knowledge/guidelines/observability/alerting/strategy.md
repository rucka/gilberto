| High   | Medium  | P2       | 15 minutes        | 30 minutes        |
| Medium | High    | P2       | 15 minutes        | 30 minutes        |
| Medium | Medium  | P3       | 1 hour            | 2 hours           |
| Low    | High    | P3       | 1 hour            | 2 hours           |
| Low    | Medium  | P4       | 4 hours           | Next business day |
| Low    | Low     | P5       | Next business day | None              |
