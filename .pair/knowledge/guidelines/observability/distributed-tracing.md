# Distributed Tracing

## Purpose

Define distributed tracing strategies for tracking requests across microservices and distributed systems to identify performance bottlenecks and understand system interactions.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Distributed tracing implementation strategies
- Trace collection and analysis
- Service interaction mapping
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Request flow visualization
- OpenTelemetry standards and implementation

#### Out of Scope:

- Single-application profiling
- Database-specific tracing tools
- Application-specific debugging techniques
- Performance optimization implementation

## Introduction

Distributed tracing provides visibility into request flows across multiple services, enabling teams to understand system behavior, identify performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues in complex distributed architectures.

## Core Concepts

### Trace Components

#### Traces:

- Complete request journey across services
- Unique identifier for request correlation
- Collection of related spans
- Request lifecycle representation

#### Spans:

- Operation timing and metadata

#### Context Propagation:

- Trace context transmission between services
- HTTP header-based propagation
- Message queue context preservation
- Cross-boundary correlation maintenance
