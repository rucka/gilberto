# 📚 Technical Guidelines Knowledge Base

This directory contains the complete technical guidelines knowledge base for the project, organized for optimal discoverability and RAG performance.

## 📋 Optimized Organization Structure

This knowledge base follows an **optimized hybrid structure**:

- **Folders**: For multi-file topics with complex sub-components
- **Standalone Files**: For consolidated topics that work well as single documents
- **Clear Navigation**: Direct paths with minimal folder nesting

This approach reduces folder pollution while maintaining logical organization and cross-referencing.
