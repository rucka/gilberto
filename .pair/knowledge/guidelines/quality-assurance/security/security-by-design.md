# 🛡️ Security by Design

Proactive security integration throughout the software development lifecycle, ensuring security considerations are embedded from conception to deployment.

## Purpose

Establish security by design principles that embed security considerations into every phase of development, creating inherently secure systems rather than retrofitting security after development.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Security requirements integration in project planning
- Threat modeling during architecture and design phases
- Secure coding practices and development standards
- Security testing integration in CI/CD pipelines
- Security architecture review and validation processes

#### Out of Scope:

- Specific security tool configurations (covered in implementation guides)
- Compliance and regulatory requirement details
- Incident response and operational security
- Third-party security assessments and vendor management

## Core Principles

### Proactive Security Integration

**Security control categories**:

- Preventive controls (input validation, access controls)
- Detective controls (monitoring, logging, alerting)
- Corrective controls (incident response, recovery procedures)
