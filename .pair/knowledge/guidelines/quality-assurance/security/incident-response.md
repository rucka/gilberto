# Incident Response Framework

## 🎯 **PURPOSE**

Structured approach to detecting, containing, investigating, and recovering from security incidents while minimizing business impact, preserving evidence for analysis, and implementing improvements to prevent similar incidents.

## 🚨 **INCIDENT RESPONSE LIFECYCLE**

### **Preparation Phase**

Effective incident response begins long before incidents occur through comprehensive preparation including team training, tool deployment, process documentation, and stakeholder communication frameworks. Preparation quality directly impacts response effectiveness.

#### Team Organization and Roles

Incident response teams require clearly defined roles including incident commander, technical leads, communications coordinator, and legal representative. Role definitions should include decision-making authority, escalation procedures, and backup personnel assignments.

#### Response Infrastructure

Dedicated incident response infrastructure includes secure communication channels, evidence collection systems, forensic analysis tools, and backup communication methods. Infrastructure should remain available even during significant system compromises.

#### Playbook Development

Incident response playbooks provide step-by-step procedures for common incident types including malware infections, data breaches, denial of service attacks, and insider threats. Playbooks reduce response time and ensure consistent investigation procedures.

### **Detection and Analysis**

Rapid incident detection and accurate initial analysis determine response effectiveness. Detection systems should minimize false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential incident indicators.

#### Multi-Source Detection

Effective detection combines automated monitoring systems, user reports, external notifications, and threat intelligence feeds. Multiple detection sources provide redundancy and improve coverage of different attack vectors.

#### Initial Triage Process

Rapid triage determines incident severity, impact scope, and required response resources. Triage procedures should balance speed with accuracy to ensure appropriate resource allocation without delay.

#### Evidence Preservation

Early evidence preservation protects crucial information that might be lost or modified during response activities. Evidence preservation should follow forensic procedures to maintain legal admissibility while supporting technical analysis.

## 🔒 **CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES**

### **Immediate Containment**

Rapid containment limits incident spread and impact while preserving evidence for investigation. Containment strategies should balance damage limitation with investigation requirements and business continuity needs.

#### Isolation Procedures

System isolation removes compromised systems from production networks while maintaining access for investigation. Isolation should prevent lateral movement while preserving system state for forensic analysis.

#### Network Segmentation

Dynamic network segmentation can contain incidents by restricting network access from compromised systems. Segmentation policies should be pre-configured to enable rapid implementation during incidents.

#### Account and Access Control

Compromised accounts require immediate access restriction to prevent unauthorized activity. Access control procedures should include password resets, multi-factor authentication verification, and privilege review.

### **Eradication and Recovery**

Complete incident eradication removes all traces of malicious activity before system recovery. Recovery procedures restore systems to known-good states while implementing additional protections against reinfection.

#### Root Cause Analysis

Thorough root cause analysis identifies how incidents occurred and what vulnerabilities enabled the compromise. Analysis results inform both immediate remediation and long-term security improvements.

#### System Hardening

Post-incident system hardening addresses identified vulnerabilities and implements additional security controls. Hardening should consider both technical controls and process improvements.

```bash
# Example incident containment script
#!/bin/bash

# Incident response containment automation
INCIDENT_ID="INC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/incident-response/${INCIDENT_ID}.log"

echo "Starting incident containment: ${INCIDENT_ID}" | tee -a $LOG_FILE

# Network isolation
echo "Implementing network isolation..." | tee -a $LOG_FILE
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP

# Process analysis
echo "Capturing running processes..." | tee -a $LOG_FILE
ps aux > /var/log/incident-response/processes-${INCIDENT_ID}.txt

# Network connections
echo "Capturing network connections..." | tee -a $LOG_FILE
netstat -tuln > /var/log/incident-response/connections-${INCIDENT_ID}.txt

echo "Containment phase completed: ${INCIDENT_ID}" | tee -a $LOG_FILE
```

## 🔍 **INVESTIGATION AND FORENSICS**

### **Digital Forensics Process**

Systematic digital forensics investigation follows established procedures to collect, preserve, analyze, and present digital evidence. Forensic procedures must maintain evidence integrity and legal admissibility.

#### Evidence Collection

Comprehensive evidence collection includes system images, log files, network captures, and memory dumps. Collection procedures should minimize system impact while ensuring complete evidence preservation.

#### Chain of Custody

Documented chain of custody tracks evidence handling from collection through analysis and presentation. Proper custody procedures ensure evidence admissibility in legal proceedings and internal investigations.

#### Timeline Reconstruction

Incident timeline reconstruction combines evidence from multiple sources to understand attack progression and identify critical decision points. Timelines help identify missed detection opportunities and response improvements.

### **Threat Actor Analysis**

Understanding threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures helps attribution and informs defensive improvements. Threat actor analysis should consider both technical indicators and behavioral patterns.

#### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

IoC identification and documentation enable threat hunting and future detection. IoCs should be shared with threat intelligence communities to improve collective security awareness.

#### Attribution Assessment

Threat attribution combines technical evidence with threat intelligence to identify likely threat actors. Attribution assessments should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid definitive claims without strong evidence.

## 📢 **COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION**

### **Internal Communications**

Clear internal communication keeps stakeholders informed while maintaining operational security. Communication procedures should specify audience, timing, and message content for different incident types and severity levels.

#### Executive Briefing

Executive briefings provide senior leadership with incident impact assessment, response status, and resource requirements. Briefings should focus on business impact and decision requirements rather than technical details.

#### Technical Team Coordination

Technical team coordination ensures efficient resource utilization and prevents conflicting response activities. Coordination includes task assignment, progress tracking, and technical decision escalation.

### **External Communications**

External communication requirements include regulatory notifications, customer communications, vendor coordination, and law enforcement interaction. Communication timing and content must balance transparency with security and legal considerations.

#### Regulatory Notification

Regulatory notification requirements vary by jurisdiction and industry but often mandate specific timeframes and content requirements. Notification procedures should ensure compliance while supporting ongoing investigation needs.

#### Customer Communication

Customer communication maintains trust and transparency while protecting sensitive investigation details. Communications should provide actionable guidance for customers to protect themselves.

## 📈 **POST-INCIDENT ACTIVITIES**

### **Lessons Learned Process**

Systematic lessons learned analysis identifies improvement opportunities in detection, response, and prevention capabilities. Analysis should include both technical and process improvements.

#### Root Cause Documentation

Comprehensive root cause documentation captures incident details, contributing factors, and remediation actions. Documentation supports organizational learning and provides reference for similar future incidents.

#### Process Improvement Implementation

Identified improvements should be formally tracked and implemented to enhance future incident response effectiveness. Implementation includes procedure updates, training modifications, and tool enhancements.

### **Recovery Validation**

Complete recovery validation ensures systems are fully restored and secured before returning to normal operations. Validation should include security testing, performance verification, and monitoring enhancement.

#### Business Continuity Restoration

Business continuity restoration procedures return operations to normal levels while maintaining enhanced monitoring for potential reinfection or related incidents.

#### Security Control Enhancement

Post-incident security control enhancements address identified vulnerabilities and improve detection capabilities. Enhancements should be prioritized based on risk assessment and resource availability.

## 🛠️ **TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES**

### **Incident Response Platforms**

Comprehensive incident response platforms provide centralized case management, evidence collection, communication coordination, and workflow automation. Platform selection should consider integration capabilities and organizational workflow requirements.

#### SOAR Integration

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms automate routine incident response tasks and coordinate tool interactions. SOAR capabilities reduce response time and ensure consistent procedure execution.

### **Forensic Analysis Tools**

Specialized forensic analysis tools support evidence examination, timeline reconstruction, and artifact analysis. Tool selection should consider evidence types, analysis requirements, and legal admissibility needs.

#### Cloud Forensics Capabilities

Cloud environment incidents require specialized forensic tools and procedures that account for virtualization, shared infrastructure, and distributed data storage. Cloud forensics must consider provider cooperation and data access limitations.

## 📋 **GOVERNANCE AND METRICS**
