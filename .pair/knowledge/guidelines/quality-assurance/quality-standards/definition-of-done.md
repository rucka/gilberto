## 📈 Observability & Monitoring

Operational readiness requires robust observability practices to ensure system health, reliability, and rapid incident response. All deliverables must comply with the following observability requirements, aligned with [Observability Guidelines](../../observability/README.md):

### Monitoring Requirements

- **Monitoring Coverage:** All critical services and components must be monitored for uptime, error rates, latency, and resource utilization.
- **Alerting:** Automated alerts must be configured for key health indicators and threshold breaches.
- **Dashboards:** Real-time dashboards should be available for system health, performance, and business metrics.

### Logging Standards

- **Structured Logging:** All logs must use structured formats (e.g., JSON) to enable automated parsing and analysis.
- **Log Levels:** Use standardized log levels (info, warning, error, debug) across all services.
- **Sensitive Data:** Logs must not contain sensitive or personal data.
- **Centralized Logging:** All logs must be aggregated in a centralized logging system for search and analysis.

### Observability Checklist

- [ ] Monitoring configured for all critical services
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented and documented
- [ ] Structured logging enabled and verified
- [ ] Log aggregation and retention policies defined
- [ ] Alerting rules and escalation paths documented
- [ ] Dashboards available for operational metrics
- [ ] Observability documentation updated

### Health Check Endpoints & Monitoring Setup

- **Health Check Endpoints:** Each service must expose a health check endpoint (e.g., `/healthz`) that reports on service status and dependencies.
- **Readiness & Liveness Probes:** Implement readiness and liveness probes for containerized workloads.
- **Monitoring Integration:** Health check endpoints must be integrated with monitoring systems for automated status tracking.

Refer to [Observability Guidelines](../../observability/README.md) for detailed implementation instructions.

## 🔍 Verification Process

### Automated Checks

1. **CI/CD Pipeline** → All tests and quality gates pass
2. **Security Scanning** → Vulnerability and dependency scanning
3. **Performance Monitoring** → Automated benchmarks validation

### Manual Reviews

1. **Code Review** → Peer review focusing on maintainability
2. **Security Review** → Manual assessment per [Security Guidelines](../security/security-guidelines.md)
3. **Accessibility Testing** → Manual validation per [Accessibility Guidelines](../accessibility/README.md)
4. **UX Review** → Design team approval for user-facing changes
