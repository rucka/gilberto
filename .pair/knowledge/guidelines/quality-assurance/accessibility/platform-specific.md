        isAccessibilityElement = true
        accessibilityLabel = "\(titleLabel.text ?? ""), \(subtitleLabel.text ?? "")"
        accessibilityTraits = .button
        accessibilityHint = "Double tap to view details"

        // Support for custom actions
        accessibilityCustomActions = [
            UIAccessibilityCustomAction(name: "Add to favorites") { _ in
                self.addToFavorites()
                return true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### ATK/AT-SPI Integration

Linux applications should integrate with Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) and Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI) for screen reader support.

#### Orca Screen Reader Compatibility

Applications should be tested with Orca screen reader to ensure proper accessibility implementation on Linux platforms.

#### Desktop Environment Variations

Different Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE) have varying accessibility implementations requiring appropriate testing and support.

## 🥽 **EMERGING PLATFORM ACCESSIBILITY**
