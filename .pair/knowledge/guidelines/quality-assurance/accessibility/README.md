## 🏗️ **ACCESSIBILITY ARCHITECTURE**

Accessibility is not an add-on feature but a fundamental aspect of software design that must be considered from the earliest stages of development through deployment and maintenance.

### **Accessibility Philosophy**

**Universal Design Approach**: Design products that are usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

**Inclusive by Default**: Make accessibility the default approach rather than an afterthought, ensuring that inclusive design principles guide all development decisions.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Build a solid foundation of accessible functionality and enhance the experience for users with different abilities and technologies.

**User-Centered Validation**: Involve users with disabilities in the testing and validation process to ensure real-world accessibility effectiveness.
