# Performance Targets and Benchmarks Framework

## 🎯 **PURPOSE**

Comprehensive framework for establishing, managing, and achieving performance targets and benchmarks that align with user expectations, business objectives, and technical capabilities across web applications and digital experiences.

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE TARGET FUNDAMENTALS**

### **Target-Setting Methodology**

Performance targets should be based on user research, business requirements, competitive analysis, and technical constraints rather than arbitrary goals or industry averages.

#### User-Centric Target Definition

Performance targets should reflect actual user experience impact including perceived performance, task completion efficiency, and satisfaction metrics.

#### Business-Aligned Performance Goals

Performance targets must align with business objectives including conversion rates, user engagement, and revenue impact to ensure organizational support and resource allocation.

#### Technically Achievable Targets

Performance targets should be technically achievable within available resources and constraints while providing meaningful improvement over current performance.

### **Performance Target Categories**

#### Core Web Vitals Targets

Google's Core Web Vitals provide standardized targets for essential user experience metrics including loading, interactivity, and visual stability.

#### Custom Business Metrics

Business-specific performance metrics including checkout completion time, search response time, and feature-specific interaction performance.

#### Technical Performance Benchmarks

Infrastructure and technical performance targets including server response times, database query performance, and resource utilization efficiency.
