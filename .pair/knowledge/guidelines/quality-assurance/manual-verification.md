### **Relationship with Manual Testing Guidelines**

This framework defines **who** verifies, **when** in the SDLC, and **which areas** require human judgment. For the operational mechanics of **how** to design, structure, and execute repeatable manual test cases (test case format, critical path grouping, AI-assisted execution, report generation), see [manual-testing.md](manual-testing.md).

The two are complementary:

- **Manual Verification** (this file) → organizational framework: roles, gates, review checklists, process phases
- **Manual Testing** → execution mechanics: test case design, variable-driven templates, critical path prioritization, suite maintenance

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS**

- **Issue Detection Rate**: Manual verification finds 90%+ of usability issues
- **Review Coverage**: 100% of critical paths manually verified
- **Review Efficiency**: Average 2-4 hours per feature for manual verification
- **User Satisfaction**: >85% user satisfaction in post-release surveys
- **Quality Escape Rate**: <5% of issues escape manual verification
