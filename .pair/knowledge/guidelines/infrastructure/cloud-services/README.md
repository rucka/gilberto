## Implementation Best Practices

### Service Integration Patterns

#### 1. API Gateway Pattern
```typescript

// Centralized API management
interface ServiceConfig {
  endpoint: string;
  apiKey: string;
  timeout: number;
  retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;
}

class CloudServiceClient {
  private config: ServiceConfig;

  constructor(config: ServiceConfig) {
    this.config = config;
  }

  async callService(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.config.endpoint}${endpoint}`, {
      method,
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.config.apiKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
      timeout: this.config.timeout,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new ServiceError(response.status, await response.text());
    }

    return response.json();
  }
}

````

#### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern

```typescript

class CircuitBreaker {
  private failures = 0
  private lastFailureTime?: Date
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED'

  constructor(private threshold: number = 5, private timeout: number = 60000) {}

  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime!.getTime() > this.timeout) {
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN')
      }
    }

    try {
      const result = await operation()
      this.onSuccess()
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure()
      throw error
    }
  }

  private onSuccess() {
    this.failures = 0
    this.state = 'CLOSED'
  }

  private onFailure() {
    this.failures++
    this.lastFailureTime = new Date()

    if (this.failures >= this.threshold) {
      this.state = 'OPEN'
    }
  }
}

```

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Service Health Monitoring

```typescript

interface ServiceHealth {
  service: string
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy'
  latency: number
  errorRate: number
  lastCheck: Date
}

class HealthChecker {
  private healthCache = new Map<string, ServiceHealth>()

  async checkServiceHealth(serviceName: string, endpoint: string): Promise<ServiceHealth> {
    const startTime = Date.now()

    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${endpoint}/health`, {
        timeout: 5000,
      })

      const latency = Date.now() - startTime
      const status = response.ok ? 'healthy' : 'degraded'

      const health: ServiceHealth = {
        service: serviceName,
        status,
        latency,
        errorRate: 0, // Calculate from metrics
        lastCheck: new Date(),
      }

      this.healthCache.set(serviceName, health)
      return health
    } catch (error) {
      const health: ServiceHealth = {
        service: serviceName,
        status: 'unhealthy',
        latency: Date.now() - startTime,
        errorRate: 100,
        lastCheck: new Date(),
      }

      this.healthCache.set(serviceName, health)
      return health
    }
  }

  getOverallHealth(): 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy' {
    const services = Array.from(this.healthCache.values())

    if (services.every(s => s.status === 'healthy')) {
      return 'healthy'
    } else if (services.some(s => s.status === 'unhealthy')) {
      return 'unhealthy'
    } else {
      return 'degraded'
    }
  }
}

```

## Security Best Practices

### Service Authentication

```typescript

// OAuth 2.0 / JWT token management
class TokenManager {
  private tokens = new Map<string, { token: string; expiry: Date }>()

  async getToken(service: string): Promise<string> {
    const cached = this.tokens.get(service)

    if (cached && cached.expiry > new Date()) {
      return cached.token
    }

    const newToken = await this.refreshToken(service)
    return newToken
  }

  private async refreshToken(service: string): Promise<string> {
    const response = await fetch('/auth/token', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        grant_type: 'client_credentials',
        scope: `service:${service}`,
      }),
    })

    const { access_token, expires_in } = await response.json()

    this.tokens.set(service, {
      token: access_token,
      expiry: new Date(Date.now() + expires_in * 1000),
    })

    return access_token
  }
}

```

### Data Encryption

```typescript

// Client-side encryption for sensitive data
import { createCipher, createDecipher } from 'crypto'

class DataEncryption {
  private algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm'
  private key: Buffer

  constructor(encryptionKey: string) {
    this.key = Buffer.from(encryptionKey, 'hex')
  }

  encrypt(text: string): string {
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16)
    const cipher = createCipher(this.algorithm, this.key)
    cipher.setAAD(Buffer.from('service-data'))

    let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex')
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex')

    const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag()

    return iv.toString('hex') + ':' + authTag.toString('hex') + ':' + encrypted
  }

  decrypt(encryptedData: string): string {
    const parts = encryptedData.split(':')
    const iv = Buffer.from(parts[0], 'hex')
    const authTag = Buffer.from(parts[1], 'hex')
    const encrypted = parts[2]

    const decipher = createDecipher(this.algorithm, this.key)
    decipher.setAAD(Buffer.from('service-data'))
    decipher.setAuthTag(authTag)

    let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8')
    decrypted += decipher.final('utf8')

    return decrypted
  }
}

```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Usage Monitoring

```typescript

// Cost tracking and optimization
interface UsageMetrics {
  service: string
  period: string
  cost: number
  usage: number
  unit: string
}

class CostOptimizer {
  async analyzeUsage(services: string[], period: string): Promise<UsageMetrics[]> {
    const metrics: UsageMetrics[] = []

    for (const service of services) {
      const usage = await this.getServiceUsage(service, period)
      metrics.push(usage)
    }

    return metrics.sort((a, b) => b.cost - a.cost)
  }

  private async getServiceUsage(service: string, period: string): Promise<UsageMetrics> {
    // Implementation would integrate with cloud provider billing APIs
    return {
      service,
      period,
      cost: 0,
      usage: 0,
      unit: 'requests',
    }
  }

  generateOptimizationRecommendations(metrics: UsageMetrics[]): string[] {
    const recommendations: string[] = []

    metrics.forEach(metric => {
      if (metric.cost > 1000) {
        recommendations.push(`Consider optimizing ${metric.service} - high cost detected`)
      }

      // Add more optimization logic
    })

    return recommendations
  }
}

```
