# CI/CD Artifacts Management

## Scope

Enterprise-grade artifact management and distribution strategies for continuous integration and deployment pipelines, focusing on security, versioning, and efficient distribution across environments.

## Content Summary

- **Artifact Types**: Application binaries, Docker images, documentation, test reports, and deployment packages
- **Storage Solutions**: Registry management, artifact repositories, and cloud storage integration
- **Security**: Signing, scanning, and access control for artifacts
- **Distribution**: Multi-environment deployment and rollback strategies

## Artifact Management Framework

### Artifact Categories

#### Application Artifacts

```yaml
# Build Artifacts Configuration
artifacts:
  applications:
    web-frontend:
      type: 'static-assets'
      format: 'tar.gz'
      storage: 's3://artifacts/frontend/'
      retention: '30d'

    api-service:
      type: 'docker-image'
      registry: 'ecr://company/api'
      tags: ['latest', 'version', 'commit-sha']

    desktop-app:
      type: 'executable'
      platforms: ['windows', 'macos', 'linux']
      signing: 'required'
```

#### Infrastructure Artifacts

```yaml
infrastructure:
  terraform-modules:
    type: 'source-package'
    versioning: 'semantic'
    storage: 'terraform-registry'

  helm-charts:
    type: 'package'
    registry: 'harbor.company.com'
    signing: 'cosign'

  ami-images:
    type: 'machine-image'
    regions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']
    encryption: 'required'
```

### Artifact Decision Matrix

| Criterion               | Container Registry | Package Registry | Object Storage | Hybrid Solution |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **Docker Images**       | ✅ Native           | ❌ No             | ❌ Limited      | ✅ Specialized   |
| **Binary Packages**     | ❌ Limited          | ✅ Native         | ✅ Good         | ✅ Optimized     |
| **Source Archives**     | ❌ Limited          | ✅ Good           | ✅ Native       | ✅ Flexible      |
| **Large Files**         | ❌ Limited          | ❌ Limited        | ✅ Native       | ✅ Optimized     |
| **Security Scanning**   | ✅ Integrated       | ⚠️ Manual        | ❌ External     | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Access Control**      | ✅ RBAC             | ✅ RBAC           | ✅ IAM          | ✅ Unified       |
| **Cost Efficiency**     | ⚠️ Medium          | ⚠️ Medium        | ✅ Low          | ⚠️ Variable     |
| **Global Distribution** | ✅ CDN              | ✅ CDN            | ✅ CDN          | ✅ Multi-CDN     |

**Recommendation: Hybrid Solution** - Use specialized registries for each artifact type with unified access control and monitoring.

## Storage Solutions

### Container Registry Strategy

```yaml
# Multi-Registry Configuration
registries:
  production:
    provider: 'aws-ecr'
    regions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']
    replication: 'cross-region'
    scanning: 'continuous'

  development:
    provider: 'harbor'
    local: true
    scanning: 'on-push'

  public:
    provider: 'docker-hub'
    images: ['base-images', 'tools']
    automation: 'github-actions'
```

### Package Repository Architecture

```yaml
# Artifact Repository Strategy
repositories:
  npm-packages:
    type: 'npm-registry'
    scope: '@company'
    backup: 'daily'

  maven-artifacts:
    type: 'nexus'
    releases: 'immutable'
    snapshots: '30d-retention'

  python-packages:
    type: 'pypi-simple'
    index: 'private'
    fallback: 'pypi.org'
```

## Security and Compliance

### Artifact Signing Strategy

```yaml
# Code Signing Configuration
signing:
  docker-images:
    tool: 'cosign'
    key-management: 'vault'
    policy: 'required'

  executables:
    windows:
      tool: 'signtool'
      certificate: 'code-signing'
      timestamp: 'required'

    macos:
      tool: 'codesign'
      identity: 'developer-id'
      notarization: 'required'
```

### Vulnerability Scanning

```yaml
# Security Scanning Pipeline
scanning:
  docker-images:
    tools: ['trivy', 'grype', 'snyk']
    gates: ['critical', 'high']
    reporting: 'security-team'

  dependencies:
    languages: ['javascript', 'python', 'java']
    frequency: 'daily'
    auto-update: 'patch-only'
```

## Distribution and Deployment

### Multi-Environment Strategy

```yaml
# Environment-Specific Distribution
distribution:
  development:
    source: 'feature-branches'
    frequency: 'on-commit'
    retention: '7d'

  staging:
    source: 'main-branch'
    frequency: 'daily'
    testing: 'automated'
    promotion: 'manual-approval'

  production:
    source: 'release-tags'
    frequency: 'on-demand'
    approval: 'multi-stage'
    rollback: 'automated'
```

### Rollback Strategy

```yaml
# Automated Rollback
rollback:
  triggers:
    - health-check-failure
    - error-rate-threshold
    - manual-trigger

  strategy:
    method: 'blue-green'
    verification: 'automated'
    timeout: '5m'

  artifacts:
    retention: 'last-5-versions'
    verification: 'checksum'
```
