# 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code Practice

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables the management and provisioning of infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## 🎯 Purpose

This practice provides comprehensive guidance for implementing Infrastructure as Code, enabling teams to:

- **Automate infrastructure management** with consistent, repeatable deployments
- **Version control infrastructure** with proper change tracking and rollback capabilities
- **Scale infrastructure operations** with enterprise-grade automation and governance
- **Ensure compliance and security** with policy as code and automated validation
- **Optimize costs and performance** through automated resource management

## 📋 When to Use This Practice

#### Essential for:

- Multi-environment deployments requiring consistency
- Teams managing complex infrastructure at scale
- Organizations requiring infrastructure compliance and auditing
- Projects needing rapid infrastructure provisioning and scaling
- Environments requiring disaster recovery and business continuity

#### Consider alternatives for:

- Simple, single-resource prototype environments
- Teams without infrastructure automation capabilities
- Legacy systems with manual configuration dependencies
- Highly specialized infrastructure requiring constant manual tuning

## 🚀 Quick Start Decision Tree

```text
Do you need infrastructure automation?
├─ Yes → Do you primarily use AWS?
│  ├─ Yes → Consider [AWS CDK Implementation](aws-cdk-implementation.md)
│  └─ No → Start with [Terraform](terraform.md)
├─ No → Consider manual infrastructure management
└─ Unsure → Review [IaC Best Practices](iac-best-practices.md) first
```
