# AI-Assisted Development Process

## Purpose

This document defines a structured methodology for AI-assisted software development that combines human expertise with AI capabilities to deliver high-quality software efficiently. The framework establishes clear responsibility boundaries between developers and AI systems, ensuring optimal collaboration while maintaining code quality, business alignment, and continuous value delivery.

The process is designed to:

- **Accelerate development velocity** through intelligent automation and AI-powered code generation
- **Maintain quality standards** via systematic review processes and automated quality checks
- **Ensure business alignment** by connecting technical implementation to strategic business objectives
- **Enable continuous learning** through captured knowledge and iterative improvements
- **Scale development practices** across teams while preserving consistency and best practices

## 🔑 Responsibility Matrix

| Symbol | Role                     | Description                       |
| ------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 🤖🤝👨‍💻  | **LLM + Dev Review**     | LLM proposes, Developer validates |
| 👨‍💻💡🤖  | **Dev + LLM Suggestion** | Developer leads, LLM supports     |
| 🤖⚡     | **LLM Agent**            | Full autonomy until completion    |
| 👨‍💻    | **Dev**                  | Developer-only activity           |

## Operational Flow

### 📘 Induction

1. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 PRD Creation** (`/pair-process-specify-prd`) → Generate Product Requirements Document from user needs & market insights
2. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Bootstrap Checklist Completion** (`/pair-process-bootstrap`) → Define technical context and operational framework through comprehensive project assessment
3. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Initiative Prioritization** (`/pair-process-plan-initiatives`) → Identify and rank initiatives by impact
4. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Subdomain Analysis** (`/pair-process-map-subdomains`) → Map relevant functional subdomains
5. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Bounded Context Definition** (`/pair-process-map-contexts`) → Define boundaries to prevent ambiguity

### 🚀 Strategic Initiatives

1. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Epic Breakdown** (`/pair-process-plan-epics`) → Divide initiative into value increments

### 🧩 Customer-Facing Iterations

1. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 User Story Breakdown** (`/pair-process-plan-stories`) → Decompose epics into granular stories
2. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Story Refinement** (`/pair-process-refine-story`) → Complete with description, scope, acceptance criteria, technical notes
3. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Task Breakdown** (`/pair-process-plan-tasks`) → Decompose stories into executable tasks

### 🛠️ Sprint Execution

1. **🤖⚡ Task Implementation** (`/pair-process-implement`) → Autonomous completion with TDD, quality gates, and commit-per-task/story strategy
2. **🤖🤝👨‍💻 Code Review** (`/pair-process-review`) → Structured review with adoption compliance, merge flow, and parent cascade
3. **🤖⚡ Status Update** → Automatic story/epic/initiative tracking update (handled by `/pair-process-implement` and `/pair-process-review`)

> **Skill-enabled workflow**: Run `/pair-next` at session start to determine the most relevant skill. See [skills-guide.md](skills-guide.md) for the full catalog of 30 skills.
